          Hi, I'm Rohit, a passionate UI/UX designer with a keen interest in creating intuitive and visually appealing digital experiences. 
          I love exploring design concepts, working on innovative projects, and constantly improving my skills. 
          Currently, I'm focused on web and mobile UI/UX design, with experience in developing landing pages, admin panels, game UI, and more. 
          I aim to blend creativity with functionality to deliver engaging user experiences. 
          When I'm not designing, you can find me at the gym on Mondays, exploring new design trends, or working on exciting game concepts.
